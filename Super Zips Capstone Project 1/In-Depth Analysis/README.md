Super Zips In-Depth Storytelling

This Jupyter notebook shows how machine learning was used to draw insights from the Education Attainment and Income score data generated previously. My hypothesis was that the data can be clearly categorized into clusters similar to the economic classes (i.e. lower class, middle class, upper class, etc.). However, after going through the analysis shown below, I found out instead that all the data forms a single cluster (this is clearly shown visually below), but I also propose an opinion on how clustering may be used and interpreted.
