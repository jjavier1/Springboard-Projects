To obtain the entire Education Attainment Dataset for 2018, follow below:

1) Navigate to https://data.census.gov/cedsci/advanced?tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01
2) For the first filter, 
	-in the "Browse Filters" column, select "Geography" 
	-in the "Geography" column, select "Zip Code Tabulation Area (Five-Digit)" 
	-in the "Within (State)" column, select the "Within Other Geographies" dropdown menu then "Zip Code Tabulation Area (Five-Digit)" 
	-in the "Zip Code Tabulation Area (Five-Digit)" column, select "All ZCTAs in United States" 
3) For the second filter,
	-in the "Browse Filters" column, select "Topics" 
	-in the "Topics" column, select "Education" 
	-in the "Education" column, select the "Educational Attainment" checkbox

4) For the third filter,
	-in the "Browse Filters" column, select "Years" 
	-in the "Years" column, select the "2018" checkbox

5) The desired table should be labelled "Educational Attainment" labelled with
	-Survey/Program: American Community Survey,
	-Years: 2018
	-Table: S1501

6) Since the table is too large to display, you'll have to download it as a CSV file. I then created the separate CSV file as a subset for faster, easier use in Excel and the Jupyter notebook.
